Welcome to the engineering blog for the Clinical Bioinformatics Team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center! We've started this blog to share some of our experiences and challenges building the next-generation of molecular diagnostic tools and processes at MSKCC. We are an extremely diverse team, so expect future posts to cover everything from front-end development to data pipelines, tools and even random technical musings.

We hope you find the posts to be helpful and insightful. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our group, please don't hesitate to reach out! We love what we do, and would be thrilled to share our experiences.
